# 362-lab2
Lab 2 for ITMD-362 class.

Pleas READ the following note.

I had to remove my Math calculations for the em conversions. Because Github was causing "405 Not Allowed" error when I was commenting mystyle.css file.  I thought the post method did not like the special characters in the comments, so I removed them.

Therefore I'm bringing some of my Math calculation to this file as documentation, as asked by Prof. Krieglstein.

/* I have Used the Minor 3rd (120%) in my Math calculations, for the ones listed below */

html {
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.25em;  /* (20px/16px=1.25em) */
  line-height: 1.2em;  /* (1.2X20=24px), (24px/20px=1.2em) */
}

body {
  font-size: 1.25em;  /* (20px/16px=1.25em) */
  line-height: 1.2em;  /* (1.2X20=24px), (24px/20px=1.2em) */
  }

p {
  padding-bottom: 1.2em;  /* (24px/20px=1.2em) */
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2.5em;  /* (50px/20px=2.5em) */
}
